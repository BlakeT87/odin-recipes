        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I’m so wild about this easy sugar cookie recipe, I may never make traditional ones again. In fact, these have been my go-to for the last couple of years. They’re infinitely easier and taste, well, just like a crunchy sugar cookie, and similar to shortbread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
                <li>2/3 cup + 3 TBSP granulated sugar, divided</li>
                <li>2 cups + 1 TBSP all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla (optional, but recommended)</li>
                <li>choice of sprinkles (rainbow is the obvious choice)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper</li>
                <li>IN a medium bowl, using handheld electric mixer, beat together butter and 2/3 cup of sugar until combined.(it will be gritty, that's to be expected)</li>
                <li>Using a cookie scoop or spoon, roll the dough into 1-inch balls</li>
                <li>Gently roll the balls in the remaining 3 TBSP of sugar until lightly coated; transfer to the baking sheets 2 inches apart</li>
                <li>Using the bottom of a glass, press down on the balls to flatten. Sprinkle with sprinkles and lightly press down again to make them stick. (The dough should end up being about 1/4 inch thick. They will look small in diameter but they will spread a bit as they cook)</li>
                <li>Bake for 14-16 minutes or until slightly golden around the edges and on the bottom</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let rest on the baking sheets for at least 10-15 minutes (don't cheat!) then eat, or transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely</li>
                <li>ENJOY!</li>
            </ol>
