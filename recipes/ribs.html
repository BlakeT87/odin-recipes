        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is what we call the 3-2-1 smoking method for fall-off-the-bone ribs at home on your smoker. This super easy recipe is sure to please all of your family and friends!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Full rack baby back ribs</li>
            <li>2 TBSP sweet heat rub</li>
            <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp salted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bbq sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by removing the membrane from the back of the ribs (pro tip - use a paper towel and butter knife. Lift the membrane with the butter knife then grip and pull with paper towel)</li>
            <li>Liberally season both sides of the ribs using the sweet heat rub (start with the bone side)</li>
            <li>Prepare your smoker for indirect smoking. Target temperature is 180 to 200 degrees fahrenheit with clean blue smoke</li>
            <li>Place the ribs on the smoker and close the lid. Leave them to smoke for 3 hours</li>
            <li>Prepare 2 large pieces of aluminum foil and place them on a working surface. </li>
            <li>After 3 hours, transfer the ribs to the aluminum foil, bone side up as to not tear the foil. Sprinkle with brown sugar, top with butter cut into pads, and pour over apple cider</li>
            <li>Tightly crimp the foil together carefully to prevent tearing and create an air-tight seal. Return to the grill and increase cooking temperature to 225 degrees. Allow the ribs to braise inside the foil for 2 hours</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the ribs from the grill and place on a large working surface. Open the foil (beware of hot steam) and move the ribs back onto the grill, bone side down. (discard the foil and liquid inside)</li>
            <li>Brush the ribs with your favorite bbq sauce, close the lid of your grill, and cook at 225 degrees for another hour until the sauce is sticky and set</li>
            <li>Remove from grill, serve, and ENJOY!</li>
        </ol>
